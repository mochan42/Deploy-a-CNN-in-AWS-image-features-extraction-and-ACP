# Deploy-a-CNN-in-AWS-image-features-extraction-and-ACP


# Aim of the project
* This project consists in running a CNN (MobileNet-V2) in an AWS Elastic Map Reduce(EMR) Cluster in order to extract features of 100 images of fruits which are stored in AWS Simple Storage Solution (S3). <br>
* The idea is to validate the image processing chain on a small number of images so that it can be used when the number of images will increase dramatically (the scaling can be easily performed by adding more EMR clusters).<br>
* Once extracted, the features are stored in AWS S3 and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed.<br>

# Walkthrough the results
* Implementation of the AWS EMR cluster :<br>
